# Getting Started

### [Installation instructions](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl/blob/master/README.md)


### Basic supervised training and testing


```julia
julia> using MLJ
julia> using RDatasets
julia> iris = dataset("datasets", "iris"); # a DataFrame
```

In MLJ one can either wrap data for supervised learning in a formal
*task* (see [Working with Tasks](working_with_tasks.md)), or work directly with the
data, split into its input and target parts:


```julia
julia> const X = iris[:, 1:4];
julia> const y = iris[:, 5];
```

A *model* is a container for hyperparameters. Assuming the
DecisionTree package is in your installation load path, we can
instantiate a DecisionTreeClassifier model like this:

```julia
julia> @load DecisionTreeClassifier
import MLJModels ✔
import DecisionTree ✔
import MLJModels.DecisionTree_.DecisionTreeClassifier ✔

julia> tree_model = DecisionTreeClassifier(target_type=String, max_depth=2)
DecisionTreeClassifier(target_type = String,
                       pruning_purity = 1.0,
                       max_depth = 2,
                       min_samples_leaf = 1,
                       min_samples_split = 2,
                       min_purity_increase = 0.0,
                       n_subfeatures = 0.0,
                       display_depth = 5,
                       post_prune = false,
                       merge_purity_threshold = 0.9,) @ 1…72
```

Wrapping the model in data creates a *machine* which will store training outcomes:

```julia
julia> tree = machine(tree_model, X, y)
Machine @ 5…78
```

Training and testing on a hold-out set:

```julia
julia> train, test = partition(eachindex(y), 0.7, shuffle=true); # 70:30 split
julia> fit!(tree, rows=train)
julia> yhat = predict(tree, X[test,:]);
julia> misclassification_rate(yhat, y[test]);

┌ Info: Training Machine{DecisionTreeClassifier{S…} @ 1…36.
└ @ MLJ /Users/anthony/Dropbox/Julia7/MLJ/src/machines.jl:68
0.08888888888888889
```

Or, in one line:

```julia
julia> evaluate!(tree, resampling=Holdout(fraction_train=0.7, shuffle=true), measure=misclassification_rate)
0.08888888888888889
```

Changing a hyperparameter and re-evaluating:

```julia
julia> tree_model.max_depth = 3
julia> evaluate!(tree, resampling=Holdout(fraction_train=0.5, shuffle=true), measure=misclassification_rate)
0.06666666666666667
```

### Next steps

To learn a little more about what MLJ can do, take the MLJ
[tour](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl/blob/master/docs/src/tour.ipynb). Read
the remainder of this document before considering more serious use of
MLJ.


### Prerequisites

MLJ assumes some familiarity with the
[CategoricalArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/CategoricalArrays.jl)
package, used for representing categorical data. For probabilistic
predictors, a basic acquaintance with
[Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl) is
also assumed.


### Data containers and scientific types

The MLJ user should acquaint themselves with some
basic assumptions about the form of data expected by MLJ, as outlined
below. 

```
machine(model::Supervised, X, y) 
machine(model::Unsupervised, X)
```

The input `X` in the above machine constructors can be any table, where
*table* means any data type supporting the
[Tables.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/Tables.jl) interface. 

> At present our API is more restrictive; see this
> [issue](https://github.com/JuliaData/Tables.jl/issues/74) with
> Tables.jl. If your Tables.jl compatible format is not working in
> MLJ, please post an issue.

In particular, `DataFrame`, `JuliaDB.IndexedTable` and
`TypedTables.Table` objects are supported, as are two Julia native
formats: *column tables* (named tuples of equal length vectors) and
*row tables* (vectors of named tuples sharing the same
keys).

For models which handle only univariate inputs
(`input_is_multivariate(model)=false`) `X` cannot be a table but is
expected to have `Vector` or `CategoricalVector` type.

The target `y` in the first constructor above must be a
`Vector` or `CategoricalVector`. A multivariate target `y` will be
vector of *tuples*. The tuples need not have uniform length, so 
some forms of sequence prediction are supported.

Conversely, the choice of element types used to represent your data
has implicit consequences about how MLJ will interpret that data.

> WIP: Eventually users will use task constructors to coerce element
> types into the requisite form. At present, the user must do so
> manually, before passing data to the constructors.

To articulate MLJ's conventions about data representation, MLJ
distinguishes between *machine* data types on the one hand (`Float64`,
`Bool`, `String`, etc) and *scientific data types* on the other,
represented by new Julia types: `Continuous`, `Multiclass{N}`,
`FiniteOrderedFactor{N}`, `Count` (unbounded ordered factor), and
`Unknown`, with obvious interpretations.  These types are organized in
a type hierarchy rooted in a new abstract type `Found`:

![](scitypes.png)

A *scientific type* is any subtype of
`Union{Missing,Found}`. Scientific types have no instances.

Scientific types appear when querying model metadata, as in this
example:

```julia
julia> info("DecisionTreeClassifier")[:target_scitype_union]

Union{Multiclass,FiniteOrderedFactor}
```

**Basic data convention.** The scientific type of data that a Julia
object `x` can represent is defined by `scitype(x)`. If `scitype(x) ==
Unknown`, then the interpretation of `x` by an MLJ model is unpredictable. 

```@example 2
using MLJ # hide

(scitype(42), scitype(π), scitype("Julia"))
```

In particular, *integers cannot be used to represent* `Multiclass` *or*
`FiniteOrderedFactor` *data*; these can be represented by an unordered or
ordered `CategoricalValue` or `CategoricalString`:

`T`                         |     `scitype(x)` for `x::T`
----------------------------|:--------------------------------
`Missing`                   |      `Missing`
`AbstractFloat`             |      `Continuous`
`Inte   ger`                |        `Count`
`CategoricalValue`          | `Multiclass{N}` where `N = nlevels(x)`, provided `x.pool.ordered == false` 
`CategoricalString`         | `Multiclass{N}` where `N = nlevels(x)`, provided `x.pool.ordered == false`
`CategoricalValue`          | `FiniteOrderedFactor{N}` where `N = nlevels(x)`, provided `x.pool.ordered == true` 
`CategoricalString`         | `FiniteOrderedFactor{N}` where `N = nlevels(x)` provided `x.pool.ordered == true`
`Integer`                   | `Count`

Here `nlevels(x) = length(levels(x.pool))`.
